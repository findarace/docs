# Webhooks

Our platform exposes **webhooks** that registration platforms can subscribe to for real-time updates. This lets you process participants, orders, and line items as they happen and keep your system in sync.

---

## Available events

Currently, the following events are available:

- `order.received`  
  Triggered when a new order is placed. Contains order-level, line item and participant information.  

- `lineitem.received`  
  Triggered for each line item when an order is placed. Contains line item and participant information.   

- `participant.created`  
  Triggered for each particpant when an order is placed. Contains only participant information.

> üóíÔ∏è A line item always represents a single event, line items for team races will contain multiple participants where applicable.
> ‚ö°Ô∏è More event types (e.g. cancellations, transfers, refunds) will be added in the future.

## Setup, delivery & security

We use **Svix** to handle delivery, verification and retries. Svix provides signature headers for verification and management/reporting tools.

Setup is managed entirely through the organiser dashboard.

### 1. Log in
Log into your organiser account at [findarace.com](https://findarace.com).  
From the top-right menu, select your organiser profile.

### 2. Go to Settings
In the sidebar, click **Settings**.  
Scroll down to the **Webhooks** section and click **Manage**.

### 3. Enable webhooks
If webhooks are disabled, click **Enable** to switch them on.

### 4. Create a webhook
Click **Create your first webhook**.  
This opens the Svix dashboard (our webhook provider).

### 5. Add an endpoint
In the Svix dashboard:
- Click **Add Endpoint**  
- Enter the URL of your endpoint (where you want events delivered)  
- Save

### 6. Subscribe to events
From the **Event Catalog** in Svix, choose the events you want to receive:  
- `order.received`  
- `lineitem.received`  
- `participant.created`  

### 7. Done
Your endpoint will now begin receiving webhooks for the selected events.
